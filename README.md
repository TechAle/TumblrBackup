# Tumblr Backup
You want a backup of your blog, so you tried to use a feature of tumblr that allows you to backup your blog.<br>
You click that feature, and it says "waiting", after 1 day "waiting", after 1 month "waiting", after 1 year "waiting"<br>
I wanted to backup my blog before deleting it, so this is why i created this.
## How this works
Basically i'm doing a reverse api of the tumblr's api, so yes it doesnt require for you to buy tumblr's developer token.<br>
Just put your blog in "main.py", and then run the code.<br>
An html file is gonna appear; this is gonna be your backup.<br>
If you prefer a .pdf, i'm sure you can find some online html to pdf generator; this html file is done in a way that everything is inside it.<br>
